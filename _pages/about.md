Hi there:)

I'm Wenji. 

Starting this September, I will be pursuing a Ph.D. at Tampere University, Finland, and I am very fortunate to be working with [Prof. Juho Kanniainen]((https://sites.google.com/site/juhokanniainen/)). My co-supervisors are Prof. Konstantinos Stefanidis, with external supervision from Prof. Alexandros Iosifidis and Prof. Jukka Mähönen. My current research interests are in Generative Machine Learning and Adversarial Machine Learning.

Previously, I focused on Mutual Adversarial Learning, GNN, and GAN. I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. Lianming Zhang.

U can find My [CV](../files/Wenji Bai CV.pdf) here.




About me
------
I absolutely love music, musicals, watching movies, and writing. 

In my spare time, I write songs. If you're interested, maybe [listen](http://163cn.tv/Qadyg0).

Also, I'm a huge fan of gaming - Nintendo is the best, hands down!
