Hi there:)

I'm Wenji. 

I'm in my final year of the M.Sc. in Computer Science at Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China. I'm very fortunate to be working with [Prof. Lianming Zhang](https://www.scholat.com/zhanglianming.en). My current research interests are on Generative Machine Learning, Deep Learning, GNN.

Previously, I focused on Mutual Adversarial Learning, Adversarial Machine Learning and GAN.

U can find My [CV](../files/Wenji Bai CV.pdf) here.




About me
------
I absolutely love music, musicals, watching movies, and writing. 

In my spare time, I write songs. If you're interested, maybe [listen](http://163cn.tv/Qadyg0).

Also, I'm a huge fan of gaming - Nintendo is the best, hands down!
